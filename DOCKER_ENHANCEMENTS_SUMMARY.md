# Docker Workflow Enhancements Summary

This document summarizes all the enhancements made to improve the Docker workflow, ensuring reliability, team velocity, and production readiness.

## 1. Makefile Enhancements

### New Targets Added
- **buildx**: Build multi-arch images for shared registries (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- **test-local**: Run unit/integration tests locally without Docker
- **lint**: Run ESLint and TypeScript compilation check
- **sbom**: Generate Software Bill of Materials for supply-chain hygiene
- **scan**: Scan image for vulnerabilities using Trivy
- **rollback**: Template for rolling back to previous image tags

### Improvements
- Enhanced help target with better formatting and colorized output
- All targets properly marked as .PHONY to prevent timestamp issues
- Self-documenting targets with embedded descriptions

## 2. Runbook Additions

### Enhanced Verification Checklist
- Added non-root UID verification with explicit check for UID ≠ 0
- Added Prisma client verification command
- Added health endpoint and graceful stop validation
- Improved .dockerignore verification guidance

### New Sections
- **CI/CD Guardrails**: Pipeline order, caching strategies, signed images, and rollback procedures
- **Operational Guidelines**: Logging standards, graceful shutdown practices, and environment safety
- **Supply Chain Hygiene**: SBOM generation and vulnerability scanning
- **Expanded Troubleshooting**: Added common issues and quick fixes

### Quick Reference
- One-screen validation updated with better explanations
- Healthcheck activation guidance with recommended parameters
- Environment safety checklist with required variables

## 3. CI/CD Improvements

### Release Pipeline
- Defined strict release order: migrate → set secrets → rollout → smoke test → promote
- Added caching strategies with BuildKit and registry cache
- Documented signed images with cosign and attestations
- Added rollback procedures and tagging strategies

### Quality Gates
- Created PR template with mandatory checklist for releases
- Added image size tracking requirements
- Included SBOM and vulnerability scan links
- Required smoke test evidence before merging

## 4. Operational Best Practices

### Logging Standards
- Standardized on JSON logs with timestamps and levels
- Documented docker logs usage and jq viewing
- Added guidance for log viewing in production

### Graceful Shutdown
- Documented SIGTERM handling requirements
- Specified expected exit time (10-15 seconds)
- Added testing procedure with docker stop

### Environment Safety
- Created secrets checklist table
- Documented fail-fast validation on process start
- Listed required environment variables

## 5. New Documentation Files

### Integration Tests Guide (INTEGRATION_TESTS.md)
- Testcontainers setup for database integration tests
- Example test structure and implementation
- CI/CD integration guidance
- Best practices and troubleshooting

### Pre-commit Hooks Guide (PRE_COMMIT_HOOKS.md)
- Setup and configuration instructions
- Hook definitions for linting, type checking, and testing
- Usage and customization guidance
- CI/CD integration patterns

### PR Template (.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
- Mandatory release checklist
- Image size tracking
- Supply chain hygiene requirements
- Healthcheck and smoke test validation

## 6. Configuration Files

### Pre-commit Configuration (.pre-commit-config.yaml)
- ESLint hook for code quality
- TypeScript check hook for type safety
- Unit test hook for breaking change prevention
- Prettier hook for code formatting

### Updated Package.json Scripts
- Added test:integration and test:integration:watch scripts
- Added lint and lint:fix scripts
- Added type-check script
- Maintained backward compatibility

## 7. Multi-Runtime Support

### Alternative Runtimes Documentation

1. **Makefile** - Added new targets and enhanced help
2. **DOCKER_RUNBOOK.md** - Comprehensive updates with new sections
3. **ALTERNATIVE_RUNTIMES.md** - Added multi-runtime notes
4. **package.json** - Added new test and lint scripts

### New Files:
1. **.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md** - Release PR template
2. **INTEGRATION_TESTS.md** - Testcontainers integration guide
3. **PRE_COMMIT_HOOKS.md** - Pre-commit hooks setup guide
4. **.pre-commit-config.yaml** - Pre-commit hook configuration
5. **DOCKER_ENHANCEMENTS_SUMMARY.md** - This summary document

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Reliability**: Enhanced verification and testing procedures
2. **Faster Development**: Local lint/test targets without Docker overhead
3. **Supply Chain Security**: SBOM generation and vulnerability scanning
4. **Production Readiness**: Graceful shutdown and operational guidelines
5. **Team Velocity**: Self-documenting Makefile and comprehensive runbook
6. **Quality Assurance**: Pre-commit hooks and integration testing guidance
7. **Auditability**: PR template with mandatory release checklist
