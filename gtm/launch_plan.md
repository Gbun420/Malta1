# Go-to-Market Launch Plan: High-Value Electronics in Malta

This document outlines the go-to-market strategy for launching the platform, with a focus on building initial supply and achieving liquidity.

## 1. Supply-First Playbook

Our launch strategy is focused on acquiring a critical mass of high-quality supply before we start marketing to buyers. This will ensure that early buyers have a good selection of items to choose from.

### Outreach & Curation

1.  **Identify Potential Sellers:** We will manually identify potential sellers by browsing existing platforms like Facebook Marketplace and MaltaPark for high-quality electronics listings.
2.  **Outreach:** We will contact these sellers directly with a personalized message.

    *   **Outreach Script (Email/Message):**
        > "Hi [Seller Name],
        >
        > I saw your listing for the [Item Name] on [Platform]. I'm part of the team launching a new platform in Malta dedicated to buying and selling high-value electronics safely and easily.
        >
        > We're impressed with the quality of your items and would like to offer you a free, white-glove onboarding experience. We'll create a premium listing for you, and for the first 90 days, all our features, including our secure payment system, are completely free.
        >
        > Our goal is to create a trusted community for electronics enthusiasts in Malta. Would you be open to being one of our first sellers?
        >
        > Best regards,
        > The [Platform Name] Team"

3.  **Onboarding Assistance:** For the first 50 sellers, we will provide a "white-glove" onboarding service:
    *   We will manually create their listings based on the information they provide.
    *   We will offer to take professional photos of their items for free.
    *   We will guide them through the verification process.

### Initial Pricing Incentives

*   **First 90 Days Free:** All listing tiers, featured placements, and commission fees will be waived for the first 90 days for all users.
*   **Quality Gating:** To be eligible for the white-glove service and special promotion, sellers must have items that meet our quality standards (e.g., recent models, good condition).

## 2. Liquidity Metrics & Weekly Targets

Liquidity will be measured by the following KPIs. We will track these metrics weekly for the first 8 weeks.

*   **Time-to-First-Response:** The time from when a listing is posted to when the seller receives the first message from a potential buyer.
*   **Response Quality:** We will survey buyers to rate the quality of the responses they receive from sellers (e.g., on a scale of 1-5).
*   **Listings with >3 Messages:** The percentage of listings that receive at least three messages from different buyers.
*   **Fill Rate:** The percentage of listings that result in a sale.

### Weekly Targets (First 8 Weeks)

| Week | New Verified Listings | Time-to-First-Response (Target) | Listings with >3 Messages (Target) | Fill Rate (Target) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 20 | < 48 hours | 10% | 5% |
| 2 | 30 | < 48 hours | 15% | 5% |
| 3 | 40 | < 36 hours | 20% | 10% |
| 4 | 50 | < 36 hours | 25% | 10% |
| 5 | 60 | < 24 hours | 30% | 15% |
| 6 | 70 | < 24 hours | 35% | 15% |
| 7 | 80 | < 24 hours | 40% | 20% |
| 8 | 100 | < 12 hours | 50% | 20% |

## 3. Referral & Featured Placement Program

To encourage early adoption and engagement, we will implement the following programs:

### Referral Program

*   **Offer:** "Refer a friend who becomes a verified seller, and you both get a free 'Premium' listing credit."
*   **Goal:** To leverage our initial user base to grow the supply of sellers organically.
*   **Trust:** The referral must be a *verified* seller to ensure we are not incentivizing low-quality or fraudulent accounts.

### Featured Placement Program

*   **Offer:** During the first 90 days, all sellers will receive one free "featured placement" credit per week.
*   **Goal:** To encourage sellers to engage with the platform and to provide them with a tool to increase the visibility of their listings.
*   **Trust:** By giving this to all sellers, we are not creating an unfair advantage for those who pay, which is important in the early stages of building a community.
