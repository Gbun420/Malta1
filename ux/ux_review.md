# UX QA Review and Recommendations

This document addresses the UX QA pass requested, with a focus on WCAG 2.2 alignment, mobile checkout heuristics, and robust empty/error states.

## 1. WCAG 2.2 A/AA Alignment

Based on a review of the previously defined flows and copy, here are recommendations to ensure WCAG 2.2 A/AA alignment:

*   **Touch Targets:** All buttons and interactive elements will have a minimum target size of 44x44 CSS pixels.
*   **Focus Management:** Ensure that opening a new panel (e.g., filters) moves the focus to the new panel, and closing it returns the focus to the element that triggered it.
*   **Input Purpose:** For form fields collecting user information (e.g., name, email), we will use the `autocomplete` attribute to help users fill out forms more easily.
*   **Error Identification:** In addition to inline error messages, we will use ARIA attributes (`aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby`) to programmatically associate errors with their respective form fields.

## 2. Mobile Checkout Heuristics

To improve the mobile checkout flow, the following changes will be made to `ux/flows.md`:

*   **Minimize Steps:** The checkout process will be a single, streamlined page.
*   **Early Cost Clarity:** The total price, including any platform fees, will be clearly displayed at the top of the checkout page.
*   **Context-Independent Labels:** All form field labels will be visible at all times, even when the field is focused and the mobile keyboard is open.
*   **Progressive Disclosure:** Non-critical fields will be hidden by default and can be revealed by the user if needed.

## 3. Empty and Error States

We will create a dedicated `ux/states.md` file to document all empty and error states. Here are some examples:

*   **Empty State (No Listings):**
    *   **Headline:** "No listings yet!"
    *   **Body:** "Be the first to list an item in this category."
    *   **Primary Action:** "List an Item" button.

*   **Error State (No Search Results):**
    *   **Headline:** "No results found for '[search query]'"
    *   **Body:** "Try a different search term or check back later."
    *   **Primary Action:** "Clear Search" button.

*   **Error State (Offline):**
    *   **Headline:** "You are offline."
    *   **Body:** "Please check your internet connection."
    *   **Primary Action:** "Retry" button.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria Additions

The new acceptance criteria will be added to the user stories in `product/backlog.md` in the next iteration.
