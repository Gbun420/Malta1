# Product Requirements Document: Vertical Malta Classifieds v0.1

## 1. Goal

The primary goal of v0.1 is to validate the high-value electronics vertical as a viable wedge into the Maltese classifieds market. We aim to create a trusted and user-friendly platform for buying and selling used electronics, with a focus on a superior mobile experience and robust user protection.

## 2. Target User Segments

*   **Casual Sellers:** Individuals in Malta looking to sell their used electronics (e.g., smartphones, laptops, cameras) for a fair price with minimal hassle and risk.
*   **Discerning Buyers:** Individuals in Malta seeking good deals on used electronics but are wary of scams and want to purchase from a trusted source.

## 3. Top 3 Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)

1.  **For Sellers:** "When I have a used electronic device I no longer need, help me sell it quickly, safely, and for a fair price, so I can declutter and make some extra cash."
2.  **For Buyers:** "When I need a specific electronic device, help me find a quality used one at a good price, without the fear of being scammed, so I can get the functionality I need without paying full retail price."
3.  **For Both:** "Help me communicate and transact with the other party in a secure and structured way, so I can feel confident and protected throughout the process."
