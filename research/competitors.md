## Strengths & Gaps per Platform

### MaltaPark
*   **Strengths:** Long-standing and well-known in Malta, with a wide range of categories. The "eStore" feature is a plus for small businesses.
*   **Gaps:** Lack of a modern mobile app experience. Perceived as losing ground to Facebook Marketplace.

### Facebook Marketplace
*   **Strengths:** Massive user base, easy to use, and integrated into a platform people use daily.
*   **Gaps:** Significant trust and safety issues due to a high prevalence of scams and a lack of effective moderation or buyer protection.

### Times of Malta Classifieds
*   **Strengths:** Strong brand reputation and a go-to for official notices and job seekers.
*   **Gaps:** Paywall and a focus on specific categories limit its appeal for general peer-to-peer classifieds.

### Malta.com Classifieds
*   **Strengths:** Free to use and covers a good range of categories.
*   **Gaps:** Appears to have lower user engagement and brand recognition compared to the market leaders.

### JustLanded Malta Classifieds
*   **Strengths:** Caters to a specific and valuable niche (expatriates).
*   **Gaps:** Limited scope and not a platform for the general Maltese population.

## Malta-Specific Pain Points for a New Entrant

1.  **Lack of Trust & Safety:** The prevalence of scams on Facebook Marketplace has created a significant trust deficit in the market.
2.  **Poor Mobile Experience:** The dominant local player, MaltaPark, lacks a strong mobile-first experience.
3.  **Fragmented Market:** The market is split between a dominant social media platform (Facebook), a traditional classifieds site (MaltaPark), and several smaller players.
4.  **No Integrated Payments:** Most platforms lack integrated and secure payment solutions, forcing users to transact in cash or via risky bank transfers.
5.  **Limited Buyer/Seller Protection:** There is a clear lack of robust buyer and seller protection mechanisms, leaving users vulnerable to fraud.
6.  **Niche Verticals are Underserved:** While there are general classifieds sites, there's an opportunity to create specialized, vertical-specific marketplaces (e.g., for high-end electronics, luxury goods, or specific hobbies).
7.  **Language & Cultural Nuances:** A platform that understands and caters to the bilingual nature of Malta (Maltese and English) and local cultural norms could have an advantage.
