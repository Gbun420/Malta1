# Moderation Pipeline

This document outlines the moderation pipeline for handling user reports and ensuring a safe and trustworthy marketplace.

## 1. Report Types

Users can report listings, messages, or other users for the following reasons:

*   **Prohibited Items:** The listing is for an item that is not allowed on our platform.
*   **Scam/Fraud:** The listing or message appears to be fraudulent or a scam.
*   **Harassment:** The user is sending harassing or abusive messages.
*   **Spam:** The user is sending unsolicited or irrelevant messages.
*   **Item Not as Described:** The item received is significantly different from the listing description.

## 2. Triage SLAs

*   **High Priority (Scam/Fraud, Harassment):** First response within 12 hours.
*   **Medium Priority (Prohibited Items, Item Not as Described):** First response within 24 hours.
*   **Low Priority (Spam):** First response within 48 hours.

## 3. Evidence Requirements

*   **For all reports:** A clear and concise description of the issue.
*   **For "Item Not as Described":** Photos or videos of the item received, highlighting the discrepancies.
*   **For "Scam/Fraud" or "Harassment":** A copy of the conversation with the other user.

## 4. Outcomes

Based on the evidence, our moderation team can take the following actions:

*   **Remove Listing:** The listing is removed from the platform.
*   **Suspend User:** The user's account is temporarily suspended.
*   **Ban User:** The user's account is permanently banned.
*   **Issue Warning:** A formal warning is issued to the user.
*   **No Action:** The report is dismissed if there is not enough evidence.

## 5. Automated vs. Manual Review

*   **Automated Checks:** We will use automated systems to scan for keywords and images related to prohibited items and common scams.
*   **Manual Review:** All user reports and flagged content will be manually reviewed by our moderation team.

## 6. Community Guidelines & Enforcement Ladder

We will have a clear set of community guidelines that all users must agree to. Violations will be handled with a clear enforcement ladder:

1.  **First Offense:** Warning.
2.  **Second Offense:** Temporary suspension.
3.  **Third Offense:** Permanent ban.

(Serious offenses like fraud or harassment may result in an immediate ban.)

## 7. Dispute Resolution

*   **Dispute Intake:** Users can open a dispute through a standardized form in the app.
*   **First Response SLA:** All disputes will receive a first response from our team within 48 hours.
*   **Mediation:** A neutral mediator from our team will review the evidence from both parties and attempt to find a resolution.
*   **Escalation:** If a resolution cannot be reached, the case will be escalated to a senior member of the moderation team for a final decision.

## 8. Ops Weekly Review

Our operations team will hold a weekly meeting to review moderation and dispute metrics, including:

*   **False Positive Rate:** The percentage of automated flags that were incorrect.
*   **False Negative Rate:** The percentage of user reports that were for items that should have been flagged automatically.
*   **Median Time-to-Action:** The median time it takes to resolve a report or dispute.
