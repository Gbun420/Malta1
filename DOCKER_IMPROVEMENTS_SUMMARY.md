# Docker Toolchain Improvements Summary

This document summarizes the final enhancements made to the Docker toolchain to keep teams fast and self-serve.

## 1. Makefile Niceties

### Self-Documenting Help Target
- Added a `.PHONY: help` target that automatically generates help output by parsing comments
- Each target now includes a descriptive comment in the format `target: ## Description`
- Developers can run `make help` to see all available commands with descriptions
- This approach avoids stale READMEs and keeps discoverability high

### .PHONY Targets
- All non-file targets are properly marked as `.PHONY` to prevent timestamp surprises
- Ensures targets always run even if a file with the same name exists

## 2. BuildKit Reminders

### Consistent Invocation
- Documented both invocation paths to ensure CI and local environments are consistent
- Added comments in Dockerfile emphasizing the need for `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`
- Noted that BuildKit is the intended backend for multi-stage builds and cache mounts

### Performance Benefits
- Added comments explaining how BuildKit cache mounts improve build speed
- Highlighted the importance of using stable base tags for high cache hit rates

## 3. Healthcheck Guidance

### Conditional Healthcheck
- Kept the HEALTHCHECK snippet in Dockerfile commented until monitoring is ready
- Added detailed comments explaining when and how to enable healthchecks
- Specified best practices for healthcheck configuration:
  - Ping /health with short timeout and low retry count to avoid false positives
  - Healthcheck transitions containers through starting â†’ healthy/unhealthy states
  - Healthchecks are enforceable by orchestrators

## 4. One-Screen Runbook Cues

### Streamlined Validation
- Updated the runbook to show build, run, and curl /health in three lines
- Added Prisma and non-root checks in two additional lines
- Included "why" explanations under each step to reinforce best practices:
  - Multi-stage builds for smaller images
  - Non-root user for security
  - Quick health check for application responsiveness
  - Prisma client verification
  - Non-root runtime confirmation

## 5. Troubleshooting Enhancements

### Expanded Common Issues
- Added "Build speed issues" to the troubleshooting section
- Recommended BuildKit, cache mounts, and stable base tags for high cache hit rates

### Quick Fixes
- Maintained existing quick fixes for common issues
- Added guidance on when to use `--no-cache` builds

## 6. Best Practices Reinforcement

### Updated Best Practices List
- Added "Healthcheck configuration" to the best practices list
- Detailed the importance of proper healthcheck configuration when enabled

## Files Modified

1. **Makefile** - Enhanced with self-documenting help target
2. **Dockerfile** - Added BuildKit usage comments and clarified healthcheck status
3. **DOCKER_RUNBOOK.md** - Expanded with BuildKit reminders, healthcheck guidance, and one-screen validation cues

These improvements ensure the Docker workflow remains fast, discoverable, and resilient while making validation a habit rather than an afterthought.
